## üìí About <a name="about"></a>

This Mini-Project is done on Quora Question Pairs Similarity dataset. In this project, I dealt with the task of pairing up the duplicate questions from quora. 

Problem statement: 
- Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.
this could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
- Tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
Note - Simalarity here referes to the Semantic similarity
